# OverC

OverC is a personal hobby project aimed at creating a unique programming language that transpiles to C. Its primary goal is to be self-hosting, meaning OverC will eventually be able to compile itself. This project is not about being better than C but about being *my language*, a language that reflects my preferences and ideas.

## Current Status

OverC is under **heavy development** and is not yet capable of compiling any programs. Here's a summary of the current progress:

- **Lexer**: âœ… Complete for the base syntax.
- **Parser**: âœ… Complete for the base syntax.
- **Semantic Analysis**: âœ… Complete for the base syntax.
- **Code Generation**: âœ… Functional.
- **Generics**: ðŸš§ Not implemented yet.
- **Tagged Unions**: ðŸš§ Not implemented yet.
- **Structs**: ðŸš§ Not implemented yet.

## Usage

### Building OverC

To build the OverC compiler:

```bash
# Build with release optimizations
nimble build -d:release
```

### Using OverC

Once built, you can use OverC to compile your programs:

```bash
# Compile an OverC source file
./oc compile test.oc

# Compile and run an OverC source file in one step
./oc run test.oc
```

### Command-line Options

OverC supports various options to customize compilation:

```bash
# Use a specific C compiler
./oc compile test.oc --compiler=clang

# Pass custom flags to the C compiler
./oc compile test.oc --cflags="-Wall -Werror"

# Build with optimizations
./oc compile test.oc --release

# Static linking
./oc compile test.oc --static
```

## Philosophy

OverC is not designed to compete with C or other programming languages. Its purpose is to be a personal language that includes features I find interesting, such as:

- **Generics** (planned)
- **Tagged Unions** (planned)
- **Pattern Matching** (planned)

## Why OverC?

The name "OverC" reflects its relationship with Câ€”it builds on C as a foundation but adds features and ideas that make it unique. It's a language for fun, learning, and self-expression.

## Roadmap

1. Complete the **type system improvements** to enhance type inference and resolution.
2. Implement **structs**, **generics**, and **tagged unions**.
3. Achieve **self-hosting** by writing OverC in OverC.
