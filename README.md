# OverC

OverC is a personal hobby project aimed at creating a unique programming language that transpile to C. Its primary goal is to be self-hosting, meaning OverC will eventually be able to compile itself. This project is not about being better than C but about being *my language*, a language that reflects my preferences and ideas.

## Current Status

OverC is under **heavy development** and is not yet capable of compiling any programs. Here's a summary of the current progress:

- **Lexer**: âœ… Complete for the base syntax.
- **Parser**: âœ… Complete for the base syntax.
- **Semantic Analysis**: âœ… Complete for the base syntax.
- **Code Generation**: ðŸš§ Not implemented yet.
- **Generics**: ðŸš§ Not implemented yet.
- **Tagged Unions**: ðŸš§ Not implemented yet.
- **Structs**: ðŸš§ Not implemented yet.

## Philosophy

OverC is not designed to compete with C or other programming languages. Its purpose is to be a personal language that includes features I find interesting, such as:

- **Generics** (planned)
- **Tagged Unions** (planned)
- **Pattern Matching** (planned)

## Why OverC?

The name "OverC" reflects its relationship with Câ€”it builds on C as a foundation but adds features and ideas that make it unique. It's a language for fun, learning, and self-expression.

## Roadmap

1. Complete the **code generation** phase to produce valid C code.
2. Implement **structs**, **generics**, and **tagged unions**.
3. Achieve **self-hosting** by writing OverC in OverC.

OverC is a personal project, but if you're interested in contributing or discussing ideas, feel free to reach out!
